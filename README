I've been wanting to throw together some non-R code to make
basic slopegraphs for quite some time. Python seems to be a bit
more accessible to folks, so it seemed like the logical choice, 
especially given how spiffy the Cairo framework is.

This intial release needs work (as the comments show).

While it does, indeed, make a pretty nice slopegraph (the demo
one is similar to one found here:

Just scroll down a bit to find the graph that looks similar with the
life expetancy data) it isn't very flexible and the numeric labels
don't line up perfectly.

Still, all you need is Cairo (http://cairographics.org/) and you should
be able to make basic slopegraphs with just a few tweaks.

The code is nearly ready for final refactoring (i.e. moving elements to
functions).
